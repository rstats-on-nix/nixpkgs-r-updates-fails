List of failed R packages builds on Hydra with rank of packages added (thanks to {packageRank}).
PRs fixing packages are also linked.

The action generating the website runs each day at midnight. Do check the original on Hydra,
because Bioconductor packages are not listed, nor packages for which somehow {packageRank}
can't find a ranking.

Contributions more than welcome!
